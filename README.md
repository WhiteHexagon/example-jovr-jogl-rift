======================

A simple example using JOGL, JOVR and Oculus Rift DK2

Currently Targeting OpenGL 2.1

I get ~113fps on OSX 10.8.5 on a mid-2010 MBP.

Work In Progress.

run targets:
RiftClient0440NoMatirx - textures added, but viewport is wrong??
RiftClient0440 - strange matrix effect
RiftClient0440PVM - does not display anything

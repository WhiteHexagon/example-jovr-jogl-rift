======================

A simple example using JOGL, JOVR and Oculus Rift DK2

Currently Targeting OpenGL 2.1

Work in progress - trying to fix ModelView Matrix problems and OSX issues.

no longer runs on OSX 10.8.5 - requires custom build of JOVR with MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.8

RiftClient0420 runs (change the JOVR dependency to 042) but with a model view matrix issue...
RiftClient0430 fails to run
